## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario


## Part 2 – Reflection

I learned how to design and implement algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently, gaining hands-on experience with data structures, coding practices, and optimization techniques. Additionally, I discovered news ways to code and had a lot of fun dealing with news coding languages such as bash and vim. Overall, it was a fun experience as I not only met new people who I became friends with I also learnt a lot about the various technology is emerging.
