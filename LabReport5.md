## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario

1. 


## Part 2 – Reflection

I learned how to design and implement algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently, gaining hands-on experience with data structures, software development, debugging, coding practices, and optimization techniques. Additionally, I discovered new  coding languages such as bash and vim. For me, the most interesting part of the course was tryiing to make servers from scatch and trying to create our very own autograders. Overall, it was a fun experience as I not only met new people who I became great friends with I also learned a lot about the various emerging technologies such as ChatGPT.
