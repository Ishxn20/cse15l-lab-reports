For Asher James

Fumbling the bag, oh what a shame
A missed opportunity, a chance gone in vain
Regret fills your heart, and pain your mind
For the bag that was fumbled, is hard to find

But don't despair, don't give up hope
For the bag that was fumbled, is not the end of the rope
Keep moving forward, and stay on track
For a new bag will come, and you can get it back

Learn from the fumble, and grow from the fall
For every mistake, is a lesson to recall
So pick yourself up, and dust off the dirt
For the bag that you'll grab, will be your worth
